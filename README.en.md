`drission` provides an asynchronous, `tokio`-based browser control API. Its default Chrome DevTools
Protocol backend supports Chrome, Edge, Brave, Chromium, and Electron. The `drs` binary exposes the
same foundation through a command-line interface, a JSON protocol, and a local MCP server for test
tools, data-processing scripts, and AI coding clients.

> data, or conduct attacks or harassment. See [Responsible use](#responsible-use) and [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Choose an interface

| Interface | Best for | Get started |
|---|---|---|
| `drission` | Browser control in a Rust application | Use the pinned v0.4.0 Git command below |
| `drs` CLI | Terminal or script use with stable JSON output | Download a prebuilt Release binary |
| `drs` MCP | Local browser tools for Cursor, Codex, and other MCP-compatible clients | Install `drs`, then run `drs setup` |

## Quick start

### Rust library

The current repository and Release version is **v0.6.4**. Chromium/CDP is enabled by default.
The crates.io `drission` package is currently still at 0.3.2, so the commands below pin the
published Git tag:

```bash
cargo add drission --git https://github.com/MageGojo/drission-rs --tag v0.6.4
```

```toml
[dependencies]
drission = { git = "https://github.com/MageGojo/drission-rs", tag = "v0.6.4" }
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

```rust
use drission::prelude::*;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> drission::Result<()> {
    let browser = Browser::launch(BrowserOptions::new().headless(true)).await?;
    let tab = browser.new_tab(Some("https://example.com")).await?;

    println!("title: {:?}", tab.title().await?);
    println!("h1: {:?}", tab.ele_text("h1").await?);

    browser.quit().await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

Run the minimal repository example:

```bash
cargo run --example cdp_demo
```

The default backend detects a locally installed Chromium-family browser. See
[Chrome download](docs/Chrome自动下载.md) and [server deployment](docs/服务器部署.md) for browser
selection, managed downloads, and headless environments.

### `drs` CLI and MCP

The recommended installation path is a prebuilt `drs` binary with its SHA-256 checksum from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/MageGojo/drission-rs/releases/tag/v0.4.0) or
[GitCode Releases](https://gitcode.com/Roufsi/drission-rs/releases). It does not require a Rust
toolchain.

You can also build and install from the published Git tag. This command was verified with
`drs 0.2.0`:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/MageGojo/drission-rs --tag v0.4.0 drission-cli --bin drs
```

The crates.io `drission-cli` package is currently still at 0.1.0; do not omit `--git` when installing
the CLI that accompanies v0.4.0. Installer scripts are also available under [`install/`](install/);
inspect a script before executing it.

Common commands:

```bash
drs ensure-serve --backend cdp --headless
drs --json open https://example.com
drs ax --outline
drs screenshot --out page.png --full
```

Preview MCP configuration changes before applying them:

```bash
drs setup --dry-run
drs setup
```

`drs setup` merges the Cursor project configuration and Codex user configuration without replacing
other MCP servers. By default, MCP connects to a persistent local browser process so tabs and browser
configuration can survive MCP process restarts. See the [CLI / MCP guide](docs/CLI.md) and
[persistent browser guide](docs/mcp-持久浏览器.md) for commands, JSON responses, tools, and manual setup.

## Core capabilities

- **Asynchronous browser control:** navigation, locators, clicking, typing, keyboard input, scrolling,
  file uploads, iframes, Shadow DOM, and multiple tabs.
- **Page and network observation:** HTML, text, screenshots, PDF, console events, WebSocket events,
  XHR / Fetch monitoring, and request interception.
- **Accessibility and recording:** accessibility-tree snapshots and authorized interaction recording
  to Rust or JSON action sequences.
- **Concurrency and recovery:** browser pools, proxy health checks, retry policies, and checkpoints.
- **Local tool interfaces:** CLI, a JSONL daemon, and stdio MCP for integration with other languages
  and local AI clients.
- **Runtime governance:** profile leases, cooldowns, failure classification, risk records, and ledger
  queries for auditable automation jobs.
- **Optional visual components:** offline OCR and image-position analysis for owned or explicitly
  authorized test environments.

## Features

| Feature | Contents | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `cdp` | CDP backend for Chrome, Edge, Brave, Chromium, and Electron | Yes |
| `camoufox` | Camoufox / Firefox Juggler compatibility backend | No |
| `ocr` | Offline text recognition using `tract` | No |
| `slider` | Image-position analysis for authorized tests; enables `camoufox` | No |
| `signer` | Embedded QuickJS for local JavaScript compatibility testing | No |
| `impersonate` | HTTP client compatibility profiles; requires CMake and a C toolchain | No |

Example configurations:

```toml
# Default CDP backend with OCR
drission = { git = "https://github.com/MageGojo/drission-rs", tag = "v0.4.0", features = ["ocr"] }

# Camoufox backend only
# drission = { git = "https://github.com/MageGojo/drission-rs", tag = "v0.4.0", default-features = false, features = ["camoufox"] }
```

Refer to [Cargo.toml](Cargo.toml) and the [API documentation](https://docs.rs/drission) for the
authoritative feature dependency and build requirements.

## Compatibility

| Item | Supported range |
|---|---|
| Rust | 1.85 or newer, edition 2024 |
| Operating systems | macOS, Linux, Windows |
| Default backend | Chromium / CDP |
| Default browser selection | Google Chrome first; Edge, Brave, Chromium, and Electron are also supported |
